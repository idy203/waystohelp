  <h2>Buy Second-Hand Clothes</h2>
  <p>Instead of buying directly from fast fashion brands, look for second-hand and pre-owned pieces on apps like Mercari, Poshmark, ThredUp, Depop, and more!</p>
<h2>Buy Less</h2>
<p>Before purchasing an item, really think about whether you really need it or not.</p>
<h2>Don't Be a Victim to Sale Items</h2>
<p>Fast fashion stores tend to promote lots of sales. 20% off! 75%! 90%! As tempting as it may be, you could save money by not buying whatever is promoted in the first place.</p>
<h2>Buy Clothes From Sustainable Brands</h2>
<p>Though more expensive, sustainable brands have the consumers in mind as people, not wallets. They usually make their clothes vegan, high quality, and meant to last for years instead of just a few months. They are an investment, but one that won't cause you to be constantly buying!</p>

  <h2>Buy Better Quality</h2>
  <p>Tying in with sustainable brands, buying a quality piece of clothing that you'll love for years will be better than spending money on a new shirt every three months once one loses its appeal.</p>
  <h2>Don't Just Throw Away Your Clothes</h2>
  <p>Have a shirt that doesn't fit anymore? A hoodie you don't like the style of? Before throwing it away, try selling it online through the apps mentioned previously, and if no one buys it after a while, go ahead and donate it to local shelters or causes!</p>
  <h2>Think About Versatility</h2>
  <p>How many pieces of your wardobe actually work together and can be paired with each other? Instead of buying many unique pieces, have clothes that can compliment each other well, with a minimal amount of unique clothes.</p>
  <h2>Love What You Wear</h2>
  <p>If you think you are going to only wear something a few times, or you're buying something for an event, instead think to perhaps borrow a piece from a friend! It'll save you money from wearing something only once, and you can instead focus your money on stuff you love that you'll wear a lot!</p>
